| Weight(indepent feature)    | Hight(dependent feature)     | 
|------------|------------|
| 74         |  170cm     | 
| 80         |  180cm     |
| 75         |  175.5cm   |

- **o/p id depndent feature** bcz acc to the inde. feature depend. feature keeps changing .
- Here our agenda is we train a model , after train , when we give new weight it will predict a new height
